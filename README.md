I am using the script at <https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide>

which says:

"Please note that this script updates every day automatically using the time of your computer. Hence, it might show an error message if you try to download the file before we have updated it"
